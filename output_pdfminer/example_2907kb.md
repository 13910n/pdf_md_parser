request  that  the  Bidder  submit  the  necessary  information  or 
documentation,  within  a  reasonable  period  of  time,  to  rectify 
nonmaterial  nonconformities  in  the  bid  related  to  documentation 
requirements.  Such  nonconformities  shall  not  be  related  to  any 
aspect of the price of the bid. Failure of the Bidder to comply with 
the request may result in the rejection of its bid.

(b) 

## Group B: all other bids. 

## To facilitate this classification by the Purchaser, the Bidder must provide in 
its bid all the evidence necessary to classify its bid in Group A.  

33.3 The Purchaser will first examine the bids to ascertain in which group 
the Bidders have classified their bids when preparing their bids.  It 
will confirm or modify this classification if necessary.  

33.4 All evaluated bids in each group will then be compared with each other 
to  determine  the  lowest  evaluated  bid  in  each  group.  The  lowest 
evaluated bid from each group will then be compared with the lowest 
evaluated  bid  from  the  other  groups.  If  the  comparison  results  in  a 
## Group  A  Bid  being  the  lowest  evaluated  Bid,  the  Bidder  that 
submitted the lowest evaluated Bid will be awarded the contract.  

33.5 Where, as a result of the above comparison, the lowest evaluated bid 
is from Group B, such Group B bid shall be further compared with 
the lowest evaluated bid from Group A, after adding to the evaluated 
price of the imported goods on offer in the lowest Group B bid, and 
for the sole purpose of such further comparison, 15% of the bid price 
of such goods.1.6  

33.6 Where  Group  A's  bid  is  the  lowest  evaluated  bid  in  this 
supplementary comparison, it will be selected.  Otherwise, the lowest 
evaluated bid of Group B, pursuant to the provisions of ITB 34.5, will 
be selected.

## The Contracting Authority must prepare and include this Section IV in the bid document. This 
## Section includes, as a minimum, a description of the Goods and Services to be provided and 
the Time Schedule for their delivery.  

## This Section IV is intended to provide bidders with sufficient information to enable them to 
prepare their bids efficiently and accurately, particularly the Price Schedules, for which Section 
## III provides standard forms. In addition, this Section IV, used jointly with the Price Schedules 
(Section III), helps to adjust prices if quantities change at the time of award in accordance with 
## Clause 39 of the Instructions to Bidders (IB).  

## The date or timing of delivery of the Goods must be carefully specified, considering: (a) the 
implications of the terms used to define delivery, which are specified in the IB and defined in 
the International Trade Terms (Incoterms), and (b) the prescribed date, which is the date from 
which  the  Contracting  Authority's  obligations  begin  (e.g.,  notification  of  contract  award, 
signing of contract, opening or confirmation of letter of credit).

3.  Technical Specifications 

## The purpose of the Technical Specifications (GCC, if applicable, and SCC) is to define the 
technical  characteristics  of  the  Goods  and  Related  Services  required  by  the  Contracting 
## Authority. The Contracting Authority prepares the detailed technical specifications taking into 
account that:  
- - the  technical  clauses  are  the  benchmark  against  which  the  Contracting  Authority 
checks  the  compliance  of  bids  and  then  evaluates  them.  Therefore,  well-defined 
technical clauses facilitate the preparation of compliant bids by the bidders, as well as 
the preliminary examination, evaluation, and comparison of bids by the Contracting 
## Authority. 

the technical clauses require that all goods, as well as the materials of which they are 
made, are new, unused, of the latest or current design, and include all improvements 
in design and materials, unless otherwise specified in the contract.  
- standardisation  of  technical  specifications  may  be  advantageous,  depending  on  the 

complexity of the Goods and the repetitive nature of the procurement.  
- - The equipment, material and labour standards specified in the bid documents should 
not  be  restrictive.  International  standards  should  be  used  wherever  possible. 
## References to brand names, catalogue numbers, or other details that limit materials or 
items  to  a  particular  Manufacturer  should  be  avoided  wherever  possible.  Where 
unavoidable, such a description of an item should always be accompanied by the words 
"or substantially equivalent".  
- The technical clauses should detail the requirements for, among others, the following 

aspects: 

(a)  Material  and  manufacturing  standards  required  for  the  production  and 

manufacture of the Goods. 

(b) Details of testing (nature and number); 

(c) Additional ancillary services required to ensure proper delivery/performance; 

(d)  Detailed  activities  to  be  carried  out  by  the  Bidder,  and  any  involvement  of  the 

## Contracting Authority in these activities; 

(e)  List  of  performance  bonds  (details)  covered  by  the  Guarantee  and  details  of 
penalties  applicable  in  the  event  of  failure  to  comply  with  these  performance 
bonds.   
- The  technical  clauses  specify  the  main  technical  and  operating 
characteristics required, as well as other requirements, such as maximum 
or  minimum  guaranteed  values,  as  appropriate.  If  necessary,  the

## Contracting Authority may include an ad hoc form (attached to the bid 
letter) in which the Bidder provides detailed information on acceptable 
or guaranteed values for the operating characteristics.  

## Where the Contracting Authority requires the Bidder to provide in the bid some or all of the 
technical  clauses,  technical  documents,  or  other  technical  information,  the  Contracting 
## Authority shall specify in detail the nature and quantity of the information requested, and its 
presentation in the bid. 

[If a summary of the technical clauses is to be provided, the Contracting Authority shall insert 
the information in the Table below. The Bidder shall prepare a similar table showing that the 
requirements are met].

service  assignments  and  partnership  contracts  for  a  period  fixed

these sanctions may be extended to any company that owns the majority 
of the capital of the  offending company,  or  of  which the latter is  the 
majority shareholder. 

## When  the  violations  committed  are  established  after  the  award  of  a 
contract, the sanction pronounced may be coupled with the termination 
of the relevant  contract or the substitution of another company at the 
expense and risk of the company found in breach.

against the decisions of the Dispute Settlement Committee. This appeal 
does not have suspensive effect.
