I. 
COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY SNAPSHOT 
 
1. 
Development context. Bhutan is a small, landlocked, and mountainous country located 
along the eastern ridges of the Himalayas. It has a population of about 780,000, with 40% being 
below the age of 24.1 Bhutan has made good progress in reducing poverty and improving its 
education and health indicators, assisted by strong economic growth (which averaged 6.5% 
during 1990–2019), and the constitutionally mandated provision of free basic health services and 
education up to the tenth grade. It achieved the target of reducing  extreme poverty rate by 50%—
set under the Millennium Development Goals—in 2007, ahead of schedule. Headcount poverty, 
based on the poverty line of $3.65 per person per day in 2017 purchasing power parity, fell from 
9% in 2017 to 1% in 2022, despite the disruptions caused by the coronavirus disease (COVID-
19) pandemic. Primary school enrollment is nearly universal, and the gross secondary school 
enrollment rate in 2022 was 95% for girls and 82% for boys. Participation in college has doubled 
since 2013, and there is broad gender parity. From 2010 to 2020, the infant mortality rate 
improved from 34 per 1,000 live births to 23 per 1,000 live births, and the maternal mortality rate 
declined from 117 per 100,000 live births to 60 per 100,000 live births. As of 2021, all households 
had access to electricity, 97% to basic drinking water, and 77% to at least basic sanitation. Bhutan 
is making progress on about 58% (72 indicators) of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 
indicators for which sufficient data are available. However, rural-urban differences in levels of 
income, poverty, and access to public services, and persistently high levels of youth 
unemployment remain matters of concern. 
 
2. 
Emerging challenges. Bhutan’s annual average gross domestic product (GDP) growth 
slowed from 8% during 2000–2009 to 6% during 2010–2019, and further to –0.3% during 2020–
2022 due to the pandemic. Post-pandemic economic recovery remains weak. Bhutan’s GDP grew 
by 4.4% in 2021, 5.2% in 2022, and 4.0% (estimated) in 2023.2 It is projected to grow by 5.7% 
during 2024–2025.3 To reverse the slowdown and create conditions for high and inclusive growth, 
Bhutan needs to address the following challenges: (i) a narrow economic base and heavy 
dependence on the hydropower sector, (ii) worsening macro-fiscal position and growing debt, (iii) 
continuing dominance of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), (iv) absence of an enabling 
environment for the private sector, (v) vulnerability to climate change and disasters, (vi) high levels 
of youth unemployment and outmigration, and (vii) weak public sector management (PSM) and 
lack of adequate transparency. 
 
3. 
Asian Development Bank strategic priorities. The overarching goal of the new Asian 
Development Bank (ADB) country partnership strategy (CPS), 2024–2028 is to reinforce Bhutan’s 
efforts in fostering inclusive, sustainable, resilient, and job-creating growth. The priorities of the 
CPS are based on Bhutan’s needs, ADB’s comparative advantage and experience, and lessons 
and recommendations of the final review of the CPS, 2019–2023 and its validation report 
prepared by ADB’s Independent Evaluation Department.4 The CPS will focus on: (i) strengthening 
PSM and enabling private sector development (PSD), (ii) building climate-adaptive and resilient 
infrastructure and systems, and (iii) supporting human capital development and enhancing the

employability of youth.5 In line with ADB’s new operating model, there will be a shift towards PSD, 
and climate change and disaster risk reduction and management under the CPS, 2024–2028.6 
There will be more focus on regional cooperation and integration (RCI) to facilitate trade, improve 
cross-border connectivity, and create business and employment opportunities. ADB staff across 
sovereign and nonsovereign teams will work together to offer multisector, integrated solutions. 
Gender equality and social inclusion will be further mainstreamed in the design and 
implementation of loans, technical assistance (TA), and knowledge products. 
 
4. 
Alignment with government plans and ADB’s corporate strategy. Bhutan’s 
substantial achievements in economic growth and poverty reduction enabled it to graduate from 
least-developed country status on 13 December 2023.7 The Thirteenth Five Year Plan, 2024–
2029, and the long-term growth strategy, 2024–2034, lay down ambitious targets:8 (i) increase 
GDP from about $3 billion in 2023 to $5 billion in 2029, and $10 billion by 2034; and (ii) make 
Bhutan a high-income economy by raising per capita income from $3,879 in 2023 to more than 
$12,000 by 2034.9 Under the CPS, 2024–2028, ADB will reinforce the government’s efforts in 
working towards these goals. The strategic priorities are aligned with the operational priorities 
(OPs) of ADB Strategy 2030—in particular, addressing remaining poverty and reducing 
inequalities (OP1); accelerating progress in gender equality (OP2); tackling climate change, 
building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability (OP3); 
strengthening governance and institutional capacity (OP 6); and fostering RCI (OP7).10 
 
5. 
Value addition and selectivity. ADB will add value by tapping synergies across different 
sectors and themes, and its sovereign and nonsovereign operations. The three strategic priorities 
will be operationalized through a combination of (i) policy-based loans that support public sector 
and financial market reforms to unlock systemic obstacles impeding PSD and trade, and to 
incentivize climate adaptation; (ii) investment loans to create sustainable, resilient, and 
ecologically friendly infrastructure; and (iii) TA and knowledge products to build capacity for 
analytical work and policy reforms, improve PSM, promote public–private partnerships (PPPs), 
and strengthen climate adaptation and disaster resilience. ADB will be selective and operate in 
areas of its comparative advantage—e.g., renewable energy (solar and hydropower), river basin 
management, urban resilience, transport connectivity with a focus on RCI, and human capital 
development—where other development partners are either absent or operate at a small and 
fragmented level, and where the government values on ADB’s expertise and knowledge.

II. 
COUNTRY DEVELOPMENT CONTEXT 
 
6. 
Significant progress in poverty reduction and human development. Bhutan has done 
well in reducing poverty, and improving social, education, and health indicators. It is on track to 
achieve SDG 1 (no poverty), SDG 3 (good health and well-being), SDG 6 (clean water and 
sanitation), and SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy). Performance on SDG 2 (zero hunger), 
SDG 4 (quality education), SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), and SDG 15 (life 
on land) has also been good. However, Bhutan is regressing on SDG 8 (decent work and 
economic growth), SDG 9 (industry, innovation, and infrastructure), and SDG 13 (climate action).

5 From 1983 to 31 December 2023, ADB committed $1.2 billion to Bhutan across 207 public sector loans, grants, and 
technical assistance (TA) projects. Cumulative loan and grant disbursements to Bhutan total $914.7 million.

Bhutan ranked 125th out of 193 economies in the Human Development Index for 2023.11 While 
school and college enrollment rates are quite high in Bhutan, the quality of education and 
employment outcomes remains weak. Quality of education as measured by learning-adjusted 
years of schooling places Bhutan second-lowest in South Asia at 6.3.12 Bhutan was the second-
lowest South Asian country on the Human Capital Index in 2020, with a score of 0.48.13 Only 1 in 
4 persons with disabilities were literate or had attended formal education in 2021.14 During 2017–
2022, life expectancy rose from 70.8 years to 71.8 years, while the multidimensional poverty index 
declined from 5.8% to 2.1% as delivery of basic services improved. Since the national poverty 
line was revised upward in 2022, the rate in 2017 (8.2%) cannot be compared with that in 2022 
(12.4%). The 2022 rural poverty rate was 17.5%, as compared to the urban rate of 4.2%. 
 
7. 
Decline in long-term economic growth, 2000–2019. Bhutan’s economic performance in 
recent years has been weak. It faces both structural constraints and new challenges (para. 2). 
Unless these are addressed, Bhutan will find it difficult to achieve its ambitious development goals 
(para. 4). Bhutan’s strong average annual GDP growth during 2000–2009 (8%) was mainly due 
to the commissioning of two hydropower plants—the 60 megawatt (MW) Kurichhu plant in 2002 
and the 1,020 MW Tala plant in 2007; strong manufacturing growth led by power-intensive, 
mineral-based industries including ferrosilicon, cement, and ceramics; and the opening up of the 
economy as a result of economic reforms. Hydropower, manufacturing, construction, financial 
services, and real estate contributed about 60% of the growth during this period. However, 
Bhutan’s average annual growth rate declined to 6% during 2010–2019 because of a slowdown 
in manufacturing, lack of effective reforms to reduce the regulatory burden on the private sector, 
growing dominance of SOEs, and the commissioning of only a single hydropower plant (the 720 
MW Mangdechhu plant) in late 2019. GDP per capita tripled from $723 in 2000 to $2,194 in 2010, 
but grew by only 1.7 times to $3,688 in 2019.15 
 
8. 
Slow post-pandemic recovery. The COVID-19 pandemic dealt a severe blow to 
Bhutan’s economy, which had already begun to slow down over the preceding decade. Through 
a combination of measures, including lockdowns, strict travel and quarantine requirements, and 
high vaccine coverage (about 95%), the government controlled the spread of infection effectively. 
There were only 21 COVID-19 deaths in Bhutan. However, the prolonged restrictions, border 
closure with India, and ban on tourism caused Bhutan’s economy to contract by 10.2% in 2020. 
Fiscal and monetary stimulus measures helped to buffer small businesses and vulnerable sectors 
from the adverse impact of the economic slowdown and job losses, but weakened Bhutan’s fiscal 
position and raised debt levels. 
 
9. 
Worsening fiscal performance. In 2018 and 2019, Bhutan’s fiscal deficit was low at 2.4% 
and 1.1% of GDP. The collapse in economic activities during the pandemic caused tax and nontax 
revenue to decline sharply. Government spending on COVID-19 relief, rescheduling of loan 
repayments, and economic stimulus spending pushed up the fiscal deficit to 6.7% of GDP by 
2023. The tax-to-GDP ratio declined from 15.7% in 2018 to 12.2% in 2020 before increasing to 
13.3% in 2023. More needs to be done to reform tax policy and modernize tax. The Property Tax

Act of Bhutan 2022 introduced a uniform value-based property tax rate of 0.1% on all properties. 
This led to a sharp increase in revenue, from $0.7 million in 2022 to $7.5 million in 2023. The 
Ministry of Finance (MOF) projects an annual revenue of around $7 million because of the revised 
property taxes. It is estimated that if Bhutan transitions to a goods and services tax (expected in 
July 2025), additional taxes of around 1.1% of GDP can be mobilized.16 
 
10. 
Large current account imbalance. Due to its small size, Bhutan relies heavily on imports 
of essential goods, including petroleum, machine parts, consumer goods, computers, coal, and 
rice and other food items from India. Barring hydropower exports to India, most other Bhutanese 
exports (ferrosilicon, gypsum, dolomite, cement, and boulders) are extractive and have low value 
addition. Owing to this heavy dependence on imports, low value-added exports, and poor terms 
of trade, Bhutan’s current account continues to be in deficit. It was 19.8% of GDP on average 
between 2016 to 2019, but it worsened to 31.2% of GDP in 2022. From 2019 to 2023, gross 
international reserves, comprising mainly Indian rupees and United States (US) dollars, declined 
from $1,214 million to $607 million. Low foreign exchange inflows because of the weak recovery 
of the tourism sector, depreciation of the ngultrum relative to the US dollar, and a large increase 
in imports of bitcoin mining equipment—valued at about $539 million from July 2021 to June 
2023—contributed to this decline in foreign exchange.17 Import coverage fell from 14.7 months in 
2019 to 5.5 months in 2023.18 Hydropower exports to India declined from $303 million in 2021 to 
$217 million in 2023 because of poor hydrologic flows and an increase in domestic power 
consumption from bitcoin mining.19 Since the bulk of Bhutan’s imports is denominated in Indian 
rupees, a decline in rupee earnings from hydropower exports is cause for concern.   
 
11. 
Growing debt levels. The public debt-to-GDP ratio increased from 94% in fiscal year (FY) 
2019 to 136.8% in FY2023. The external debt-to-GDP ratio is 120.6%, or 88.2% of total public 
debt. About 69% of Bhutan’s external debt is because of hydropower projects. The Government 
of India is the lender for these projects and the main buyer of the power generated. This debt is 
self-liquidating because it is paid back after the hydropower projects are commissioned and the 
sale of power to India begins. There is no exchange rate risk because the debt is denominated in 
Indian rupees. Consequently, the Article IV mission of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 
May 2022 (footnote 16) assessed the risk of public debt distress as moderate. Domestic debt rose 
from 4.2% of GDP in FY2019 to 16.2% of GDP in FY2023. More than 95% of domestic debt is 
composed of government bonds and treasury bills, reflecting a high level of financial repression.20 
 
12. 
Narrow economic base and dominance of hydropower. Bhutan’s economic base is 
narrow. Hydropower projects, both, during construction and after commissioning, have 
traditionally been the main driver of Bhutan’s economy. During 2011–2020, annual earnings from 
hydropower exports to India accounted for an average of 10% of GDP, 33% of government 
revenue, and 35% of export earnings. However, since the hydropower sector is very capital-
intensive, it accounts for only around 1% of direct employment. GDP growth spikes in the years 
when new hydropower plants are commissioned and begin selling power to India. Bhutan’s 
hydropower production capacity increased from 1,660 MW in 2015 to 2,326 MW in 2019. This is

19 Domestic sales of electricity increased from $50 million in 2021 to $81 million in 2023. If significant power exports 
are diverted for bitcoin mining instead of being sold to India, this will impact the inflow of Indian rupee reserves, which 
are critical given Bhutan’s high import dependence on India.

expected to increase to 3,473 MW by 2025 with the commissioning of the Nikachhu hydropower 
project (118 MW), which is partly funded by ADB, and the Punatsangchhu II project (1,020 MW), 
which is funded by the Government of India. The Government of Bhutan plans to increase 
hydropower capacity further and is looking for financiers for large projects such as Dorjilung 
(1,125 MW) and Kholongchhu (600 MW). While the expanded hydropower production will help 
Bhutan increase power sales to India, part of the added generation capacity must be used to 
provide inexpensive and reliable power to support diversification of Bhutan’s economy into light 
manufacturing, food processing, call center, (given the English language fluency of many 
Bhutanese and its good internet coverage), and creative industries. 
 
13. 
Dominance of state-owned enterprises. Bhutan has 35 state-owned enterprises 
(SOEs) operating across multiple sectors including agriculture, energy, manufacturing, real 
estate, wholesale and retail trade, banking, insurance, telecommunication, aviation, 
manufacturing, and mining. Representatives of Bhutan’s private sector often raise concerns that 
some SOEs (e.g., those in agriculture, livestock, media, and housing) crowd out private players 
because they benefit from government subsidies, tax incentives, and preferential procurement 
terms. Over the years, the mandates of most SOEs have expanded beyond their core social 
objectives, resulting in mismanagement and higher losses. In 2021, SOEs generated revenues 
of $729.5 million or about 30% of GDP, an increase of 16% over 2020. The five best-performing 
SOEs generated a profit of $140.8 million while the five worst-performing posted a loss of $24.0 
million.21 The SOEs accounted for 11,000 jobs (3.5% of total national employment) in 2021.22 
Their assets equaled 207.0% of GDP in 2021. Ten SOEs alone account for 95% of SOE assets. 
From FY2017 to FY2021, about $125 million (at an exchange rate of $1 = Nu78) was disbursed 
as subsidies to the SOEs under MOF. Considering the small size of Bhutan’s economy and the 
growing fiscal stress, the rationale and performance of some SOEs should be reassessed. 
 
14. 
Lack of an enabling environment for private sector growth. Economic diversification 
has been constrained because of Bhutan’s location, small market, and the absence of an enabling 
policy and regulatory environment for the private sector. While the government has enacted 
several reforms to promote foreign direct investment (FDI) and PPPs, develop the finance sector, 
and encourage competition, the desired results have not been achieved so far.23 FDI (excluding 
the hydropower sector) remains very low, falling from 0.13% of GDP in 2019 to an average of 
0.04% of GDP for 2020–2022. The private sector continues to be heavily regulated. Frequent 
policy changes and lack of adequate consultations raise uncertainty for the private sector. Despite 
government pronouncements seeking to boost FDI, some requirements imposed on foreign 
ventures make Bhutan less attractive. Barriers include the complex approval process and 
absence of a single window for investors, equity restrictions that make it difficult to find local 
partners, minimum investment restrictions, and difficulties in obtaining and renewing visas for 
foreign staff. Bhutan’s banks are burdened by high nonperforming loan rates. The private sector 
has to compete with the SOEs for credit, raw materials, labor, and market share. In 2022, only 
30% of employed individuals worked for a private business. Without the private sector generating 
more quality jobs, economic growth in Bhutan will not be equitable. More needs to be done to 
promote trade by harmonizing customs procedures and export certification requirements.

15. 
High youth unemployment and migration. Bhutan’s overall unemployment rate 
increased from 2.7% in 2019 to 5.9% in 2022, and then declined to 3.5% in 2023. However, youth 
unemployment reached an alarming 28.6% in 2022 owing to the slowdown in economic activities 
and the return of many overseas Bhutanese workers during the pandemic. The post-COVID-19 
lifting of travel restrictions has allowed most of these workers to resume their overseas 
assignments. This lowered youth unemployment to 22.9% in the first quarter of 2024. While 
emigration of Bhutanese youth and professionals began in 2014, the level has increased sharply 
since the end of the pandemic because of the continuing lack of adequate job opportunities. 
During 2021–2023, 9,352 civil servants resigned, while several hundreds availed of long leave.24 
Ex-civil servants, students, doctors and health workers, teachers, engineers, and other 
professionals account for the majority of migrants. About 64,000 Bhutanese, or 9% of the total 
population, are estimated to be overseas.25 This brain drain is destabilizing for a small country 
such as Bhutan. 
 
16. 
Mismatch between labor supply and demand. There is a mismatch between the jobs 
available domestically and those for which Bhutanese youth aspire. Paradoxically, although youth 
unemployment is high, in 2023 the Department of Labor issued permits for 137,324 foreign 
workers. About 72% were for jobs in the construction sector, with 79,201 approvals for masonry 
workers, 18,298 for concrete workers, 8,132 for carpenters, 5,846 for process workers, and 4,675 
for rod binders or sheet metal workers.26 Local employers often prefer to hire foreign workers 
rather than locals because they are perceived to have higher skills and are willing to work for 
lower wages.27 With ADB’s support, the government is reforming and expanding its technical and 
vocational education and training (TVET) system. It is emphasizing science, technology, 
engineering, and mathematics education. While these are positive steps, more needs to be done 
to lower the cost of doing business, enable the private sector, and reduce the dominance of SOEs 
so that more job opportunities aligned with changing youth aspirations can be created. 
 
17. 
Shifting health needs. Despite a strong service delivery structure, Bhutan’s health 
system faces several challenges, including disparities in access to and utilization of health 
services between urban and rural areas.28 Although health infrastructure and facility distribution 
have been planned based on health facility catchment zones, the migration of people from rural 
to urban areas has led to overcrowding in urban hospitals and underutilization of rural health 
facilities.29 While communicable diseases remain a substantial burden, noncommunicable 
diseases are increasing and account for about 69% of all deaths in Bhutan.30 The outmigration of 
doctors, nurses, and other health personnel is affecting the government’s capacity to provide 
timely health services.  
 
18. 
Gender equality and social inclusion. Bhutan ranks 103rd out of 146 countries in the 
Global Gender Gap report.31 Despite the progress made in gender equality and women’s 
empowerment, gender inequalities persist, intersecting with issues of social exclusion. 
Challenges remain for women in employment and decision-making, deepened by cultural and

societal norms that limit their participation in the workforce. Women’s unemployment rate (7.9%) 
exceeds that of men (4.4%). The labor force participation rate is much lower for women (56.8%) 
than men (72.4%). In 2021, about 58% of the workers in the agriculture sector were women. The 
poverty rate for households headed by women (12.5%) is slightly higher than the rate for 
households headed by men (12.3%).32 Gender-based violence is pervasive—44.6% of women 
and girls in Bhutan in 2017 report having experienced one or more types of violence from their 
partner in their lifetime. Fewer women than men are enrolled in TVET and in science, technology, 
and engineering fields. While informal safety nets are strong, there are few formal mechanisms, 
for vulnerable groups such as persons with disabilities, injuries, and illnesses, who accounted for 
9% of the unemployed in 2022. About 80% of people with disabilities reside in  rural areas. 
 
19. 
Rise in economic inequality. While progress against poverty has been strong, including 
in rural areas, overall income inequality has widened. The income-based Gini coefficient 
increased from 0.55 in 2007 to 0.60 in 2022. Rural poverty rate is nearly four times higher than 
the urban rate. During 2017–2022, the urban population increased from 40% to 44% of the total 
population. Households in rural areas have difficulty in accessing essential services. Their travel 
time to hospitals and banks is about four times that of urban households. The average rural 
household is a 45-minute walk from the nearest paved road, compared to 8 minutes for the 
average urban household.33 
 
20. 
Regional disparities. Bhutan has 20 dzongkhags (districts). Thimphu accounts for 19.1% 
of the total population, Chukha for 9.5%, and Samtse for 8.6%.34 About half of Bhutan’s poor live 
in the southern and eastern dzongkhags of Chukha, Mongar, Samtse, Samdrup Jongkhar, 
Trashigang, and Zhemgang. The quality and coverage of roads, schools, and health facilities in 
these areas remain below par. Close to 85% of the tourist inflows are to Paro, Punakha, and 
Thimphu. Migration of people from rural, poor, and underserved dzongkhags to cities in search of 
employment opportunities has been increasing. Infrastructure investment should target Bhutan’s 
underserved dzongkhags to ensure growth is broad-based. 
 
21. 
Challenges and opportunities to sustainability and resilience. Bhutan’s geologically 
fragile and steep topography make it highly susceptible to geophysical risks. Climate change, 
rising global temperatures, and irregular precipitation patterns increase the frequency and 
intensity of extreme weather events, with impacts that include flooding, glacial lake outburst 
floods, landslides, and forest fires. Current trends are projected to persist, posing increasing 
threats to communities, agricultural land, infrastructure, and Bhutan’s biodiversity. The 
hydropower sector, which is critical for Bhutan’s economy, can be adversely affected by climate 
change in the years ahead. ADB’s shift toward climate change and disaster risk management 
under its new operating model presents an opportunity to provide greater support to the 
Government of Bhutan’s climate commitments and programs, and ensure alignment with 
government’s priorities by providing TA and knowledge solutions for climate adaptation, 
investment planning, and conducting multi-hazard risk assessments to inform ADB operations.

III. 
COUNTRY STRATEGY FRAMEWORK 
 
A. 
Lessons from Previous Strategy 
 
22. 
ADB’s CPS for Bhutan, 2019–2023 aimed to foster economic diversification and reduce 
spatial and social disparities. It focused on (i) dynamic economic reforms to foster a resilient and 
diversified economy, (ii) improved connectivity to provide access to information and markets, and 
(iii) greater inclusiveness through more equitable socioeconomic development. The CPS final 
review assessed ADB’s operations in Bhutan during 2019–2023 successful based on relevance, 
effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability, and development impact (footnote 4). As a result of the 
pandemic, which affected nearly half of the CPS period, ADB had to provide urgent support to the 
government for addressing COVID-19-related challenges. ADB approved $247.11 million in 
concessional ordinary capital resources lending (COL) and $32 million in Asian Development 
Fund 13 thematic grants during 2020–2023. Of this, $30 million in COL was for COVID-19 relief. 
 
23. 
The Independent Evaluation Department’s validation report of the CPS final review 
supports the review’s findings and recommendations. It rates the overall program relevant, 
effective, efficient, and likely sustainable, with less than satisfactory development impact. It 
recommends that the new CPS focus on (i) fostering reforms that would enable PSD to support 
increased economic growth, (ii) supporting policy reforms and investments for skills development 
and job creation, (iii) providing tailored support to strengthen institutional capacity for improved 
due diligence and project management, and (iv) strengthening donor partnerships to source  grant 
and concessional cofinancing for Bhutan. These recommendations are in line with those of the 
CPS final review and have been incorporated into the strategic priorities of CPS, 2024–2028 
(section III D). 
 
B. 
National Development Strategy 
 
24. 
The government has set out ambitious growth targets under its Thirteenth Five Year Plan 
(for 2024–2029) and its long-term growth strategy for 2024–2034 (para. 4).35 By 2027, the 
government aims to create full employment by generating an adequate number of quality jobs, 
and by 2030, to quadruple the income of the bottom 40% of Bhutan’s population. The 13th Plan 
allocates $829 million for infrastructure development; $878 million for local government projects; 
$731 million for human resource development to expand health, educational, vocational, and 
technical training institutes; and $122 million for development of information and communication 
technology. The current government, which assumed office on 28 January 2024, has announced 
an economic stimulus plan (valued at about $180 million) to boost investment, scale up 
investment in hydropower, improve road connectivity, promote tourism and trade, enable the 
private sector, and attract FDI. 
 
C. 
Role of Development Partners 
 
25. 
The main development partners (excluding the Government of India) currently active in 
Bhutan include ADB, the European Union, the Japan International Cooperation Agency, the IMF, 
the World Bank, the United Nations and its agencies, and the South Asian Association for 
Regional Cooperation Development Fund. Since Bhutan is small, development partners 
coordinate closely to ensure aid effectiveness.36 They meet during country programming

35 Spending for the Thirteenth Five Year Plan ($6.4 billion) is about 64% higher than that for the Twelfth Five Year Plan 
($3.9 billion). The Government of India will provide $1.25 billion, or about 20% of the outlay. 
36  Details of the programs and pipelines of donor partners are in the Development Coordination Matrix (Annex 2).

discussions, project design and implementation missions, and visits of their senior management 
to Bhutan. ADB, the IMF, and the World Bank staff coordinate on all policy-based loans. ADB, the 
Japan International Cooperation Agency, and the World Bank have joint meetings to identify and 
tap synergies across proposed support for RCI and hydropower. ADB and the United Nations 
agencies keep each other informed about the support for agriculture, health, and TVET reform. 
 
D. 
ADB’s Strategic Objectives and Operational Priorities 
 
26. 
The CPS, 2024–2028 will support inclusive, sustainable, resilient, and job-creating growth 
in Bhutan through the following strategic priorities:

1. 
Strategic Priority 1: Strengthen Public Sector Management and Enable 
Private Sector Development 
 
27. 
Strategic priority 1 will be supported through a mix of policy-based loans, TA for 
institutional strengthening, and knowledge work to support reforms in PSM, economic policies, 
and financial markets to unlock systemic obstacles and enable PSD. The reforms and institutional 
strengthening will reinforce the support under strategic priorities 2 and 3 to selectively address 
infrastructure bottlenecks and promote human capital development. 
 
28. 
Strengthen public sector management and domestic resource mobilization. The 
Thirteenth Five Year Plan emphasizes the need to strengthen PSM, reduce the fiscal deficit, and 
mobilize more tax and nontax revenue. ADB will provide technical support in coordination with 
the IMF and the World Bank to guide the rollout of the goods and services tax, build the capacity 
of the Department of Revenue and Customs, and digitize tax administration. It will help the 
government to implement the medium-term PFM strategy and prepare the road map for an 
integrated financial management information system to enhance efficiency and transparency. 
ADB and the World Bank are helping the government to reform the procurement system to ensure 
value for money, reduce implementation delays, and guide evidence-based adjustments in 
procurement policies and procedures. ADB will continue to build the analytical capacity of the 
MOF, the National Statistics Bureau, and the Royal Monetary Authority for evidence-based policy 
making and implementation. ADB supported the government in preparing a reform strategy for 
the 10 SOEs that are under the MOF. It will support the reform of selected SOEs to reduce the 
crowding out of the private sector and the burden on the budget. 
 
29. 
Enable private sector development and build public–private partnership capacity. 
ADB’s sovereign and nonsovereign operations teams will work together to undertake sector 
feasibility studies and provide transaction advisory services to promote PPPs in health 
diagnostics, solar power, and urban waste management as requested by the government. This 
will help catalyze private sector investment from within and outside Bhutan, and improve the 
design and delivery of public services. Consulting support will be provided to build the 
government’s capacity to identify and structure PPPs and raise the awareness of policy makers. 
ADB will assist the government in drafting a competition bill to ensure equal opportunity for all 
businesses. It will update Bhutan’s Bankruptcy Law to align insolvency procedures with the needs 
of small and medium enterprises. ADB is helping the government to review the FDI policy and 
improve the investment climate. 
 
30. 
Facilitate trade and promote financial market development. For a landlocked country 
such as Bhutan, RCI is critical for generating business and jobs. ADB will support reforms to 
strengthen policies, institutions, and infrastructure for open trade, including simplification and 
harmonization of cross-border protocols. It will target improvements in Bhutan’s trade

10



digitalization, competitiveness, and governance so that the full benefits from improved road and 
digital connectivity along Bhutan’s southern border with India can be tapped to boost trade, 
business, and employment opportunities. ADB will build on past support for financial market 
development by helping Bhutan to undertake additional reforms in banking, nonbanking, 
insurance, and capital markets, and build the capacity of banks to transition to non-collateral-
based lending for businesses. 
 
31. 
Support reforms for climate adaptation and green financing. ADB has supported 
Bhutan in designing national adaptation plans for agriculture and livestock, energy, and water. It 
will help the government in implementing these plans and identifying sources of climate financing 
for priority adaptation investment projects. The scope for mobilizing additional green financing 
and tapping carbon credits will be explored. ADB will assist Bhutan in accessing carbon finance 
to incentivize investments in mitigation actions. Resources will be mobilized from ADB’s Article 6 
Support Facility to help Bhutan increase its engagement under the Paris Agreement and access 
carbon finance through the sale of carbon credits in international carbon markets including 
through ADB’s Climate Action Catalyst Fund.

2. 
Strategic Priority 2: Build Climate Adaptive and Resilient Infrastructure and 
Systems 
 
32. 
Build quality infrastructure in underserved areas. Considering Bhutan’s infrastructure 
gaps and the growing threat of climate change and disasters, ADB will increase support for 
sustainable, resilient, and ecologically friendly infrastructure investments. For example, it will (i) 
help Bhutan to expand its solar power capacity to reduce its winter power deficit and scale up its 
hydropower capacity;37 (ii) build a 92-kilometer ecologically friendly highway connecting 
Lhamoizingkha to Sarpang along Bhutan’s southern border with India to reduce travel time by 
nearly 2 hours and promote cross-border trade; and (iii) support sustainable river basin 
management and resilient urban development. 
 
33. 
Strengthen climate adaptation and disaster resilience. Under the new CPS, ADB’s 
support will go beyond project-by-project mainstreaming of climate change adaptation. It will take 
a catchment-level approach to analyze multi-hazard risks, inform the design of ADB and 
government projects, and adopt appropriate risk management measures, including nature-based 
solutions, to enhance adaptation and resilience. The TA for Building Adaptation and Resilience in 
the Hindu Kush Himalayas (Bhutan and Nepal) will build the capacity of government agencies to 
assess multi-hazard risks and strengthen early warning systems.38 International best practices, 
including nature-based solutions for stabilizing slopes and managing landslide and flood risks, 
will be tailored to Bhutan’s needs. ADB will use its project readiness financing facility to help 
Bhutan develop a pipeline of well-designed energy, transport, and urban projects. Project teams 
will draw on multisector expertise and explore PPP solutions, where feasible, to ensure that 
integrated and nature-positive solutions are offered to Bhutan.

37 All hydropower projects of Bhutan are run-of-the-river. The peak generation capacity of 2,342 MW during summer 
and monsoon months falls to about 415 MW of firm power during winter. In the winters of 2022 and 2023 Bhutan had 
to import power from India’s Energy Exchange at higher unit rates than those at which it sells power to India.

11



3. 
Strategic Priority 3: Support Human Capital Development and Enhance 
Employability of the Youth 
 
34. 
Support reforms in technical and vocational education and training. Human capital 
development (including social protection) is a priority of Bhutan’s Thirteenth Five Year Plan . ADB 
will continue to help Bhutan maintain progress on SDGs pertaining to education and health quality 
and access, especially for the poor and disadvantaged, including unemployed youth, women, 
persons with disabilities, and rural inhabitants. This support is especially critical given high levels 
of outmigration (para. 15). ADB will strengthen skills pathways through vocational secondary 
schools and market-driven, mid- to advanced-level skilling programs. It will continue to support 
TVET and life skills with a focus on females and youth with disabilities, and upgrade the facilities 
of special needs schools. 
 
35. 
Strengthen health systems.  ADB will continue to strengthen Bhutan’s health system by 
providing medical equipment at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels; develop human resources 
for health; and support digitalization of health services to enhance equitable access to quality 
health care. It will provide advisory support to explore private sector engagement in health 
diagnostics and telemedicine.

4. 
Thematic Considerations Across Priorities 
 
36. 
Private sector development. As part of the CPS, a detailed PSD plan has been prepared 
to anchor PSD and operations in country programming and align various sovereign, 
nonsovereign, advisory, and knowledge operations. It draws on nearly 2 years of policy dialogue 
with the MOF, relevant ministries, and private sector representatives. The plan will enable PSD 
by (i) improving the business environment, (ii) creating an enabling environment for PPPs, and 
(iii) facilitating SOE reforms. These initiatives largely fall under strategic priority 1 of the CPS. 
Several upstream, midstream, and downstream strategies have been identified to leverage ADB’s 
sovereign and nonsovereign operations to support PSD. 
 
37. 
Climate change, disaster resilience, and environment. ADB's engagement in Bhutan 
includes infrastructure support for renewable energy, transport, integrated water resources 
management, and resilient urban development; policy and technical advice for designing and 
operationalizing the national adaptation plans; and assistance for banks to integrate green 
financing norms in their lending. ADB has prepared a country climate change and disaster risk 
management plan that aligns  planned interventions with the government’s climate commitments 
and priorities. It identifies potential synergies across various sectors to promote climate, nature, 
and social benefits. ADB will boost support for solar energy and hydropower, river basin 
management, and urban resilience. Nature-based solutions will be incorporated to strengthen the 
overall sustainability of projects. 
 
38. 
Regional cooperation and integration. As a landlocked country, Bhutan relies heavily 
on India and Bangladesh for access to ports, trade, and transit routes. About 90% of Bhutan’s 
exports by value (mainly hydropower) are to India and 80% of its imports are from India. Close to 
68% of the imports from India and 47% of the exports to India go through the Phuentsholing 
region, including though the dry port that was constructed with ADB financing. ADB’s support to 
operationalize the e-customs management system by providing laptop and desktop computers 
has helped reduce the time taken for clearing customs consignments. The CPS final review and 
the Independent Evaluation Department’s validation (footnote 4) underscore the importance of 
identifying additional opportunities in RCI under the new CPS, 2024–2028. ADB will continue to 
build on its past support as outlined in the RCI assessment prepared for the CPS. The proposed

12



Lhamoizingkha to Sarpang highway will improve connectivity with India and the Asian Highway. 
ADB’s support for expanding Bhutan’s hydropower and solar power capacity will increase the 
share of clean and renewable energy in the subregion’s power market. These RCI-focused 
infrastructure investments will be complemented by ADB’s support to improve Bhutan’s trade 
competitiveness and governance, including in customs modernization; and assisting it in aligning 
with the World Trade Organization’s Trade Facilitation Agreement, and sanitary and phytosanitary 
standards for food safety, animal, and plant health regulations, and addressing technical barriers 
to trade. ADB will ensure convergence with Bhutan’s bilateral economic and trade cooperation 
initiatives with the governments of Bangladesh and India, and the World Bank’s Accelerating 
Transport and Trade Connectivity in Eastern South Asia Program so that Bhutan benefits from 
access to improved trade logistics and wider export markets.39 These initiatives fall under strategic 
priorities 1 and 2 of the CPS, which are aligned with the South Asia Subregional Economic 
Cooperation program’s newly launched initiatives since 2023 such as tourism, food regulations 
for trade, and business linkages with the private sector. ADB will continue to provide TA to the 
programs of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation,

Gender equality and social inclusion. ADB’s support to Bhutan is aimed at reducing 
gender gaps by adopting a gender mainstreaming approach and creating more opportunities for 
women and girls. Gender equality and social inclusion considerations will be integrated through 
public sector reforms in institutional frameworks and practices. ADB will continue its gender-
inclusive focus to strengthening TVET and health systems. It will introduce innovative approaches

to support disadvantaged groups in Bhutan and ensure their access to inclusive services. Further, 
ADB will build the capacity of the government and other stakeholders to advance the gender 
equality and social inclusion agenda, focusing on enhancing knowledge and practices of gender 
mainstreaming, and exploring the intersection of gender and new and emerging areas 
 
E. 
Priorities for Knowledge Support 
 
40. 
The country knowledge plan elaborates how strategic knowledge products and services 
will be offered to the government to strengthen the analytical foundation of loans and TA projects 
under the new CPS. For example, under strategic priority 1, ADB will help the government to 
prepare feasibility studies for at least two PPP projects, support reforms of selected SOEs, update 
the insolvency law, and draft Bhutan’s first national competition bill to enable more private sector 
participation and attract FDI. National adaptation plans will be prepared for agrifood, energy, and 
water, and these will be operationalized through downstream lending and nonlending activities as 
relevant. ADB will support the Department of Revenue and Customs in preparing a digitalization 
road map to modernize tax administration and train its staff for the rollout of the goods and 
services tax. ADB will work with the MOF, the National Statistics Bureau, and the Royal Monetary 
Authority to strengthen their statistics and analytical capacity so that policy formulation and 
implementation become more data and evidence-driven.

IV. 
STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION 
 
A. 
Cost-Sharing Arrangements 
 
41. 
Bhutan is a group A (concessional assistance-only) developing member country and 
eligible for COL and Asian Development Fund resources for theme-based components.40 Project 
commitments will depend on several factors, including Bhutan’s needs and priorities, portfolio and 
sector performance, project readiness, and absorptive capacity. TA will be provided for capacity 
building, and project preparation and implementation. Country cost-sharing arrangements with 
ADB financing up to 99% of the costs for projects and TA, on an overall project portfolio-wide 
basis, will continue during the CPS period. Actual cost-sharing will be determined for each project. 
 
B. 
Implementation Priorities 
 
42. 
Improving portfolio performance and project-enhancing readiness. As a result of 
regular project review missions, two semi-annual tripartite portfolio review meetings, and periodic 
training workshops focusing on project implementation, ADB’s safeguards, procurement, gender, 
and financial management policies and procedures, the performance of Bhutan’s portfolio has 
improved in recent years.41 The portfolio reviews focus on contract administration, analyze 
reasons for implementation delays, suggest measures for course correction, and emphasize 
project readiness. A project readiness checklist emphasizing strategic procurement planning, 
advance action in terms of designing and bidding out initial procurement packages, and timely 
establishment of project management units will guide programming and pipeline discussions. The 
Government of Bhutan availed of a project readiness financing loan in 2023 to undertake detailed 
engineering design, procurement, and safeguards due diligence for two hydropower projects in

country allocations because the International Development Association (IDA) assessed it as a gap country with a 
gross national income per capita that exceeds the IDA’s operational cutoff. However, Bhutan may become eligible 
for an ADF grant country allocation from 2025 because of a change in IDA policies that came into effect in July 2024.

Vaccine Access Facility (APVAX) loan. The disbursement ratio was 24%.

the pipeline. More resources will be devoted during project design to assess the challenges posed 
by Bhutan’s fragile ecology and high risk of flooding and landslides. Appropriate mitigation and 
asset management measures will be included to make the design and implementation of ADB 
projects more climate-adaptive and resilient. 
 
43. 
Capacity building. The high turnover of experienced government counterpart staff (para. 
15), poses challenges for design and implementation of ADB projects. Hence, the frequency of 
capacity-building and training workshops organized by ADB will be increased. Bhutanese 
counterparts will also be encouraged to participate in the training workshops organized by the 
Capacity Development and Resource Center of ADB’s India Resident Mission as recommended 
in the Independent Evaluation Department’s validation report. The project administration unit of 
ADB’s Bhutan Resident Mission will be strengthened by the appointment of a country operations 
head and fielding of procurement, safeguards, and implementation consultants. 
 
44. 
Safeguards. The Government of Bhutan has initiated discussions with ADB on the use of 
country safeguards systems. Following the anticipated approval of ADB’s environmental 
safeguards framework in 2024, ADB will work with Bhutan in undertaking an assessment to 
determine whether and to what extent Bhutan’s safeguards system can be used to address the 
environmental and social risks and impacts of a project, and achieve objectives materially 
consistent with the framework. A decision on the use of all, or part, of a borrower’s environment 
and safeguards system for a project will be made by the ADB Board of Directors. 
 
45. 
Civil society organizations. The 2007 Civil Society Organization Act, amended in 2022, 
governs the civil society organization (CSO) sector in Bhutan.42 Today, Bhutanese civil society 
includes traditional self-help groups, community-based organizations, informal associations, and 
54 registered public and mutual benefit organizations. CSOs work with the government to define 
their role and develop opportunities to participate in national life, including through the recently 
established Bhutan Civil Society Network. CSOs are gradually assuming a broader advocacy role 
by engaging in public discussion on issues including gender equality and social inclusion. A 2020 
study of public perceptions of CSOs found a marked increase in public awareness of CSOs’ 
activities since 2017. Public appreciation was stronger for organizations offering services with 
tangible benefits, such as improvements in the lives of the needy, than for those working in areas 
such as knowledge generation.43 In September 2023, ADB organized the first ADB–CSO 
Partnerships Day in Bhutan, under the theme “TriUnity: Forging Pathways of Collaboration for 
Sustainable Progress.” Based on this, a civil society brief was prepared. 
 
C. 
Monitoring of Results 
 
46. 
ADB will use the CPS results framework (Annex 3) to monitor progress in implementing 
the CPS. The key outcome and output indicators have been selected to measure the main results 
that ADB-financed operations are expected to focus on or achieve during the CPS reporting 
period in support of the CPS strategic objectives. ADB will report progress and adjust the results 
framework as needed during the CPS midterm update. Progress will be monitored through ADB 
project and TA review missions, country portfolio reviews, and the country programming mission. 
ADB will provide training and capacity-building support to bolster monitoring capacity of executing 
and implementing agencies.

42 The act defines CSOs as “associations, societies, foundations, charitable trusts, not-for-profit organizations or other 
entities that are not part of the Government and do not distribute any income or profits to their members.”

D. 
Risks 
 
47. 
Macroeconomic management. To ensure that Bhutan’s economic recovery picks up 
pace and is broad-based, the government will have to take concerted measures to improve its 
macro-fiscal indicators. More transparency on how foreign exchange reserves are being 
deployed, the investment in and returns from bitcoin mining, and how the proposed Gelephu 
Mindfulness City—which will be developed into a special administrative region—impact 
government finances, and expected benefits will be required.  
 
48. 
Government’s institutional capacity. As noted, the high turnover of staff across most 
ministries and departments since 2021 is affecting the government’s capacity to plan and 
implement its programs. It is hoped that the government will take significant steps to ensure that 
the rate of turnover declines and that core institutional expertise is maintained. Policy making and 
implementation should become more consultative, transparent, and evidence-based. Private 
sector participation, both domestic and foreign, will only improve when the proposed reforms are 
deemed credible and implemented effectively. 
 
49. 
Public financial management. Bhutan’s PFM system is relatively strong, but the 
following challenges remain: (i) lack of multiyear rolling budgets, (ii) limited external audit 
coverage, (iii) lack of integration of payroll and personnel records, (iv) lack of adherence to the 
fiscal strategy, and (v) lack of timeliness and transparency in reporting public corporations’ 
financial reports. PFM-related risks also exist with respect to the government’s engagements or 
transactions in the cryptocurrency sector. In particular, the lack of information across the 
government pertaining to its digital asset mining and cryptocurrency transactions impacts its 
ability to accurately determine its financial standing and the level of fiscal risk that it is exposed to 
by virtue of such operations. This is compounded by the absence of any regulatory framework in 
the country to govern cryptocurrencies, and the lack of clear supervisory and reporting 
requirements.
