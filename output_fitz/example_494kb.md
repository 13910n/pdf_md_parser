The Services 
 
The APEC Secretariat is seeking proposals for the Peer Review and Capacity Building on APEC 
Infrastructure Development and Investment (Reviewed Economy: Peru).  
 
1. 
Background   
 
In 2015 APEC Ministers welcomed the “Reference Guide for Peer Review and Capacity Building on APEC 
Infrastructure Development and Investment”, which has been developed to implement the peer review and 
capacity building mechanism. With the reference guide in place, the next steps are to identify the volunteer 
economies, conduct peer reviews and capacity building activities from 2016 onwards. The Reference Guide 
was further updated in 2019. 
 
The objective of the peer review and capacity building is to support and promote initiatives by APEC member 
economies in advancing cross-sectoral issues under Physical Connectivity. The process consists of the 
following:

• 
Conduct peer review on policies and practices, including relevant laws, regulations and guidelines 
relating to the planning, selection and implementation process of infrastructure projects.  
• 
Address capacity building needs of the reviewed economy through peer review and provide capacity 
building activities.  
• 
Deepen knowledge through information sharing among member economies. 
 
Since 2016, five APEC economies have been reviewed. In the Philippines, the peer review was completed in 
2017, followed by two capacity building activities. In Viet Nam, the peer review and two capacity building 
activities were completed in 2018 and 2020, respectively. In Indonesia, the peer review and two capacity 
building activities were completed in 2019 and 2022–2023. The peer review for Papua New Guinea was 
completed in 2021, while the peer review for Chile started in 2023 and has been completed in 2024. 
  
Peru will be the sixth economy to be reviewed under the mechanism. Japan will serve as the facilitating 
economy (additional facilitating economies to be confirmed). The Policy Support Unit (PSU) will continue to 
support the mechanism as the ad hoc review team secretariat. In addition to assisting the review team 
members throughout the review process, the PSU will also initiate and manage the selection process for the 
members of the review team (consultants), who will consist of between 3 and 10 persons. 
 
2. 
Objectives of the Project 
 
The objectives of this project are the following:

• 
Conduct peer review on policies and practices, including relevant laws, regulations and guidelines 
relating to the planning, selection and implementation process of infrastructure projects in Peru.  
• 
Identify capacity building needs of Peru based on the results of the peer review.

information to the reviewed economy. 
• 
The review team should communicate and coordinate with the facilitating economy as appropriate in 
implementing the review. 
•

ANNEX

Scope of Peer Review  
 
The three sectors to be reviewed are:  
 
1. 
Implementation of PPP in the Sanitation Sector 
From 2014-2023, an improvement is observed in the percentage of households with basic sanitation, 
increasing from 91.4% to 95.8%, and in the percentage of households with access to safe water supply, 
rising from 28.4% to 34.7%5. Despite these advances, more than one-third of the population still faces 
challenges in accessing basic sanitation, posing a risk to public health and highlighting the need for more 
effective policies, especially in rural areas6. Indeed, access to adequate sanitation facilities is still a 
concern in rural areas with around 28% of the population facing challenges to access adequate 
sanitation facilities. This poses a significant health risk and improving sanitation infrastructure has been 
seen as one of the key solutions7.

(Billions USD)

Given the constraints of government budgets, engaging the private sector through Public-Private 
Partnerships (PPPs) emerges as a valuable endeavour to bridge the significant gap between available 
financing and rising demand. The government of Peru places emphasis on PPP projects across various 
sectors, including transportation infrastructure, electricity generation and distribution, education, 
telecommunications, ports, health, and sanitation8. Peru’s gap in infrastructure financing, up to 2038, is 
estimated to reach USD 110 billion. Transportation, sanitation, and health are three sectors in Peru 
facing large infrastructure financing gaps, with the combined shortfall across these sectors totalling USD 
80 billion9 (Figure 1). PPPs capitalize on private sector expertise in financing, designing, constructing, 
and managing sanitation infrastructure. In addition, global firms with established reputation in sanitation 
infrastructure projects could offer valuable technical expertise and experience. Foreign Direct Investment 
(FDI) from innovative firms in sanitation technology can introduce novel solutions and effective 
management methods, fostering cost-efficient and sustainable sanitation systems. 
 
2. 
Implementation of PPP in the Health Sector 
The PPP model has gained recognition as an effective tool for aiding the development of healthcare 
services. Hospital Regional de Alta Especialidad del Bajío (HRAEB), the first PPP hospital in Latin 
America, derived the following key lessons. The project emphasizes the importance of upfront 
development of PPP policy frameworks, careful project selection, and program-based approaches for 
efficiency. Early success helps establish momentum, while branding and cross-sectoral coordination, 
such as through a PPP unit, enhance program delivery. Government leadership, supported by 
experienced advisers, adds value to planning and procurement. Collaboration between finance and 
sector ministries is crucial, along with ensuring demand for assets. Finally, PPP principles can effectively 
deliver social infrastructure projects if sector-specific needs, private sector interests, and clear contract 
systems are addressed10. 
 
Legislatively, Peru has carried out efforts to boost health coverage and access. In 2008, the Universal 
Health Coverage law, Peru Resolution No. 29344 was enacted. It seeks to increase health coverage 
through an Integral Health Insurance Plan and calls for the implementation of a public-private program 
to improve healthcare access for the poorest Peruvian regions. Another resolution passed in the same 
year calls for more regional and local public investment, with more engagement of the private sector11. 
 
There have been multiple PPP projects implemented, and the Private Investment Promotion Agency 
(PROINVERSIÓN) has stated its intention to grant concessions for seven PPP projects in the health 
sector for an estimated USD 1400 million between 2024 and 2026, following the successful award of the 
EsSalud hospital projects in Piura and Chimbote for more than USD 300 million in 202312. 
 
As Peru further develops its PPP model in the healthcare sector, understanding the healthcare market 
and environment is essential. Due to Peru’s unique healthcare system, assessments of the effects of 
PPPs on the financial viability and an unequal health system should be conducted. Furthermore, factors 
such as the balance between profits and social goals must be considered. Low-priority projects (from 
the perspective of the Alma-Ata declaration adopted in 1978) may progress faster simply because they 
are more commercially appealing and bankable13. In the healthcare sector, this often results in a greater 
emphasis on secondary and tertiary care (such as hospital and highly specialized services), while 
primary healthcare, preventive care, and community clinics or health centres are frequently overlooked— 
undermining the benefits of the latter which is essential for improved health outcomes and efficiency14.

3. 
Implementation of PPP in the Transportation Sector 
Peru has made remarkable progress in modernizing its transportation infrastructure, largely through 
PPPs. By leveraging private investment, the economy has significantly expanded its network of paved 
roads and modernized airports, boosting connectivity and economic growth.  
 
In the early 1990s, less than 25% of Peru's main highways were paved, leading to significant 
transportation delays and numerous accidents. To address this, the Peruvian government implemented 
a concession model to enhance the connectivity of logistics corridors. Since 2003, the government has 
awarded 16 road concessions, resulting in USD 4.8 billion in private investment that facilitated the 
construction of 2,163 km of highways and the development or maintenance of an additional 4,057 km. 
Over the past three decades, these PPPs have significantly increased the proportion of paved roads in 
the economy-wide network, reaching approximately 83.3% by 202215. 
 
In 2020, the transportation and communications sector received the highest allocation of Peru’s public 
investment at 42% (based on data of modified institutional budget for public investment)16. However, 
despite the high budget allocation, the transportation infrastructure financing gap remains considerable, 
reaching almost USD 45 billion as of 2023 (Figure 1). 
 
In 2024, the Ministry of Transport and Communications (MTC) has tasked agency PROINVERSIÓN with 
implementing two major PPP project packages, totalling an estimated USD 4.2 billion which includes 
road corridor and airport projects17. For the road corridor projects, they involve 20 projects involving 
rehabilitation, improvement, operation and maintenance with an investment of approximately USD 5 
billion. For the airport projects, they include operation and maintenance of 8 air terminals with an 
investment of over USD 550 million.   
 
The success of Peruvian road infrastructure concessions has been influenced by several critical factors, 
including effective governance, a favourable legal framework for obtaining licenses and land acquisition, 
appropriate risk allocation, and comprehensive, realistic cost-benefit assessments18. 
 
PPP projects have also significantly enhanced Peru's airport infrastructure, leading to improved services 
and a boost in tourism. Airport modernization has increased flight operations, facilitating greater tourist 
arrivals from regions like Asia and South America. Regional airports have also benefited, with facilities 
meeting international service standards and maintaining satisfaction levels above 80%. Additionally, the 
modernization has spurred growth in related industries, with tourist accommodations increasing from 
9,600 establishments in 2005 to 26,000 in 20231920. 
 
As more PPP projects emerge within the transportation sector, adherence to industry best practices can 
help stakeholders ensure that projects are on track to successful execution 21 . Drawing on past 
successes can be helpful in developing such frameworks and criteria. Additionally, contracts should be 
well-defined, with appropriate risk management in place to address technical risks such as land 
expropriation. This would greatly reduce the potential costs involved, such as delays and contract 
renegotiations, which have impacted as many as 55% of transport concessions in Latin America22.  
 
Peru and the facilitating economy may further refine the sectors that will be reviewed as necessary.
