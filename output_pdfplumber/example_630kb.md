| As a landlocked country, Bhutan relies heavily |
| --- |
| on India and Bangladesh for access to ports, trade, and transit routes. About 90% of Bhutan’s |
| exports by value (mainly hydropower) are to India and 80% of its imports are from India. Close to |
| 68% of the imports from India and 47% of the exports to India go through the Phuentsholing |
| region, including though the dry port that was constructed with ADB financing. ADB’s support to |
| operationalize the e-customs management system by providing laptop and desktop computers |
| has helped reduce the time taken for clearing customs consignments. The CPS final review and |
| the Independent Evaluation Department’s validation (footnote 4) underscore the importance of |
| identifying additional opportunities in RCI under the new CPS, 2024–2028. ADB will continue to |
| build on its past support as outlined in the RCI assessment prepared for the CPS. The proposed |

| infrastructure investments will be complemented by ADB’s support to improve Bhutan’s trade |
| competitiveness and governance, including in customs modernization; and assisting it in aligning |
| with the World Trade Organization’s Trade Facilitation Agreement, and sanitary and phytosanitary |
| standards for food safety, animal, and plant health regulations, and addressing technical barriers |
| to trade. ADB will ensure convergence with Bhutan’s bilateral economic and trade cooperation |
| initiatives with the governments of Bangladesh and India, and the World Bank’s Accelerating |
| Transport and Trade Connectivity in Eastern South Asia Program so that Bhutan benefits from |
| access to improved trade logistics and wider export markets.39 These initiatives fall under strategic |
| priorities 1 and 2 of the CPS, which are aligned with the South Asia Subregional Economic |
| Cooperation program’s newly launched initiatives since 2023 such as tourism, food regulations |
| for trade, and business linkages with the private sector. |
